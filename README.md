# stumpyRobot
The code for my stumpy robot! Written in MATLAB, some of the functions/scripts I am executing are not written by me- those are not included in this repository
The stumpy robot is a robot created by Chandanap Aul and Fumiya Iida, and I am part of a group creating our own version of the robot.

The code is still in progress, the goal is to control both servomotors on the robot, and allow its movements to be controlled by the W, A, S and D keys on the
keyboard.
